\section*{Security Model}

The entire goal of this project to remove the implicit trust in the server. To do this, clients never store plaintext data object on the server. They first encrypt all data objects with a unique key, encrypt the key with the target user's public key, and then transmit the (Key, Object) pair to the server.

\subsection*{Trust Model}
From the client's perspective, we trust the security of the machine that the client is running on. We also trust that the client is able to keep its private key a secret from everyone. The client also trusts that the client itself is free of backdoors and remotely exploitable bugs.

The client trusts received public keys for users on first fetch. This public key is hashed and stored locally on the client in order to prevent public key man in the middle attacks orchestrated by the server.

The client also assumes that the transport mechanism for packets to and from the server is secure and not being eavesdropped upon. This project does not require use of HTTPS, so it is possible for secret tokens/cookies to be captured in the clear. In a real project HTTPS would have to be enabled to ensure this trust.

\subsection*{Threat Model}
From the client, the primary threat in this security model is a full server database compromise. The server is not to be entrusted with the plaintext data for any object. It is assumed the server can and will modify and attempt to view all data stored on its system.

\subsection*{Security Objects}
The notation is as follows:
\begin{align*}
  P_k &\rightarrow \text{Asymmetric Public Key} \\
  P_k^{-1} &\rightarrow \text{Asymmetric Private Key} \\
  D_k &\rightarrow \text{Symmetric Data Object Key} \\
  E(Key, Data) &\rightarrow \text{Encrypts $Data$ using $Key$} \\
  D(Key, Data) &\rightarrow \text{Decrypts $Data$ using $Key$} \\
  Sign(AsymKey, Data) &\rightarrow \text{Signs $Data$ using an Asymmetric Private Key, $AsymKey$} \\
\end{align*}
\subsubsection*{Client Objects}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each and every client has a unique private key $P_k^{-1}$ and public key $P_k$. This key pair is generated on the client using RSA-2048 with secure random number generators. The private key never leaves the client's machine, but the public key is freely shared to the server. 

  \item The client uses $P_k^{-1}$ to authenticate the data objects it creates and posts to the server through signing: $Sign(P_k^{-1}, Hash(Obj))$, where $Hash$ is a cryptographically secure random hash function.
  \item It uses $P_k$ to encrypt symmetric keys, $D_k$, destined for a target user, $P_k$, or itself:
    \begin{align*}
      TargetPubKey &= P_k \\
      ObjKey &= D_k \\
      EncObjKey &= E(TargetPubKey, ObjKey) \\
    \end{align*}
  \item It uses $P_k^{-1}$ to decrypt data objects received from the server and destined for it: 
    \begin{align*}
      EncObjKey &= E(P_k, D_k) \\ 
      ObjKey &= D(P_k^{-1}, EncObjKey) \\
      Obj &= D(ObjKey, EncObj) \\
    \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Server Objects}
The server must maintain a \texttt{Keychain} containing a Map of $Identifier \rightarrow KeyData$, where Identifier is a unique user ID and KeyData is an object containing the key material for that user (if authorized to view the object). \texttt{KeyData} is an object that stores the created time, expiry time, and the encrypted data key.

In order to enforce basic object permission, each object has an Access Control List (ACL). The \texttt{FBACL} maintains information on the object owner and the permissions granted to other consumers of the object. For example, if the object permissions are ONLY\_ME then only the object owner is able to view and interact with the object.

\subsection*{FAQ}
\paragraph*{How are we validating a user's data without ever being able to read it?} If a certain field cannot contain commas, we are trusting the client to not put commas. Conversely, clients who can view stored data objects have to be trusted to correctly validate/display the data correctly, regardless of actual content. Given the security model, there is no possible way to validate the content on the server. The clients must know the format of the data and reject or transform any data not matching the expected format.
  \paragraph*{How are previously trusted user's stripped of keys once they are no longer trusted (no longer friends)?} The only person who can modify the keys for a data object is the object creator. If Alice is initially friends with Bob, who shares a post with her, but then soon after defriends her, Alice's key to the post must be revoked. Revocation is impossible as Alice may have saved the key and post data for later inspection. This is analogous to saving a web page, so it is not of great concern. The server is trusted to perform correct Access Control List checks in order to prevent Alice from getting a fresh key and post data. The only case where this model would fail would be if the server is compromised and a database of online keys was used to decrypt stored data objects. One way to avoid this would be to rotate the objects key on a group membership change, or at a predefined interval, which ever comes first.
\paragraph*{What happens if a server is compromised and all data objects are leaked?} The security model states that \emph{no key material is stored on the server}. All data objects are encrypted using secret keys available only to the clients. The objects are end-to-end encrypted and a server compromise would not expose their contents. However, all \emph{metadata} would be exposed, including friends lists, content size, content times, and so forth.
\paragraph*{What happens if the server is compromised or the server operators maliciously replace data objects?} A server could maliciously replace a data object from Alice destined for Bob merely by encrypting a new object with Bob's public key. The server controls the metadata and cannot be trusted to keep accurate records. The defense to this attack would have Alice \emph{sign} all of her data objects using her private key in order to authenticate them.
\paragraph*{What happens if the server maliciously replaces public keys for users?} In this security model, clients trust the server to maintain an accurate directory of user's public key. If the server operator or other third-party were to replace a stored public key for a user with their own, then they could man in the middle any data being sent. This becomes the TLS certificate validity problem, which is not solved. There are methods to help detect invalid public keys, such as Public Key Pinning on the client or something similar to Certificate Transparency. These solutions would only allow quick detection, but they each have their own advantages and disadvantages.
 
\section*{Code Structure}

\subsection*{Client Simulator}

The client simulator is structured to create users (with each having their own actor), pages, and to have users make friends. Once these initial tasks are complete, the user actors begin simulating activity. The structure of the simulator is shown in \autoref{cli-struct}. Based off of a certain ``load factor'' users will post more frequently. This can be thought of as their aggressiveness.

  \caption{Client structure}
  \label{cli-struct}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{API Server}
The API server utilizes Spray to build a REST API using the Spray-routing DSL. In each unique REST route either an entity is deserialized using Spray-JSON or parameters are extracted from the route URI. Once the inputs are extracted, they are passed by message, along with the \texttt{RequestContext} to a data manager Actor. This actor serializes requests to Facebook data objects and implements all of the business logic for the site. This includes creating users, pages, posts, albums, and pictures. It also allows these items to be looked up by ID and retrieved. Additionally, auxiliary functions such as adding friends are implemented here due to the easy data object access. This is shown in \autoref{svr-struct}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{diagrams/server-structure.pdf}
  \caption{Server structure}
  \label{svr-struct}
\end{figure}

One limitation of this approach is that all of the data objects are stored in one Actor instance. This makes programming easy, but since actors are single threaded and can only process one message at a time, this becomes a limitation. A solution to this would be to have a more generic way of storing data such that any Actor could manage a chunk of user data. Then the API frontend would have to message a router to figure out which Actor was responsible for the required objects. This would increase the parallelism of the API server.

For organizing data, all major objects are considered ``entities'' and all derive from a similar base class (\autoref{ents}). This base class holds common attributes such as identifier and modified\_time. For example, UserEnt which holds a user's profile information derives from FacebookEntity. Each specialized Ent has its own JSON serialization and deserialization routines which allow it to be communicated over HTTP.

\subsection*{Facebook Activity}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fbact.png}
  \caption{Percentage of Activity for Facebook Users. \cite{fbactwebsite}}
  \label{fig:fbact}
\end{figure}

Worldwide, there are over 1.49 billion monthly active Facebook users \cite{fbstatswebsite}. In Europe, over 307 million people are on Facebook. On average, the Like and Share buttons are viewed on 10 million websites daily. Five new profiles are created every second, with 76 percent of Facebook users female and 66 percent male. With every minute on Facebook, 510 comments are posted, 293,000 statuses are updated, and 136,000 photos are uploaded. \\

\noindent In a study conducted from 2007 to 2010 \cite{fbstats2website}, the three biggest usage spikes of Facebook occurred on weekdays at 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. Facebook users are less active on Sundays compared to all days in the week.

\section*{Testing}
For testing, our primary metrics were the number of users simultaneously using the API and the number of sustained API requests per second. To show how the number of requests per second (hereafter r/s) increased, we used 4 clients on separate servers, each managing the same number of users. This means that each client was running the total number of users divided by 4. The plots showing the r/s over time are below.

  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{diagrams/rps-8000.png}
  \caption{8000 user simulation}
  %\label{svr-struct}
\end{figure}

As you can see, the max r/s we achieved was about 17,000. This appears to be a limit of our API server. On an 8 core machine with 2000 users, we were seeing about 370\% CPU utilization. This should have been close to 800\% if we were fully parallelized. When hitting this limit, we noticed that client connections to the API server were timing out. This means the Spray-HTTP listener was not able to keep up with the connection requests or connections were being buffered. Additionally, the API server used one Actor to manage the Facebook data access. This is limiting due to how Akka messages are handled. For a future project, a different, more scalable architecture would have to be created.
